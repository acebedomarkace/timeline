UI/UX Enhancement Plan: Homeschool Portfolio App (Optimized)
A phased plan to improve the app's UI/UX for better user guidance and a more scalable design.

Phase 1: High-Impact Quick Wins
Goal: Immediately improve user guidance and clarity with minimal effort.

Task 1.1: Enhance Empty States

Change from: "No published posts yet."

Change to: Action-oriented text like, Your timeline is ready! Click the + button to add an entry.

Reason: Guides new users and connects empty space to the primary action.

Task 1.2: Add Sidebar Icons

Action: Add a unique icon next to each sidebar heading (Family, Archives, Presentations).

Reason: Improves scannability and makes navigation faster.

Phase 2: Core Redesign
Goal: Restructure the main page for a more logical and scalable content timeline.

Task 2.1: Unify Content Feed

Action: Replace separate "Published" and "Drafts" sections with a single feed.

Implement: Add content filters (e.g., All, Published, Drafts) at the top of the new feed.

Reason: Creates a true, scalable timeline for all content types.

Task 2.2: Design Content Cards

Action: Create a reusable "Card" component for each timeline entry.

Card Elements: Title, Date, Status Badge (e.g., "Published"), Content Snippet, Thumbnail, and on-hover actions (Edit/Delete).

Reason: Provides a scannable summary of each entry.

Phase 3: Visual Polish
Goal: Refine the design system for a more professional and cohesive look.

Task 3.1: Define Typographic Hierarchy

Action: Set distinct font sizes/weights for Page Titles, Section Headers, Card Titles, and Body Text.

Reason: Improves readability and guides the user's eye.

Task 3.2: Standardize Spacing

Action: Audit all padding and margins to ensure they follow a consistent scale (e.g., multiples of 8px).

Reason: Creates a balanced, uncluttered, and professional layout.

Next Steps
Develop low-fidelity wireframes for the Phase 2 layout.

Implement Phase 1 tasks.
